  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I’m a multi-media artist based on the ancient Isle of Avalon.

The stunning landscapes which surround me, from moor to coast, are my constant inspiration.

I love to create, and doing what I enjoy is a privilege which brings me joy.

If you’d like to purchase any of my artwork, from postcards to cards and giclee prints, or if you’d like to request a commission, then send me an email at rebecca@rebeccaofavalon.art

I hope you enjoy your visit to my virtual gallery, exploring my artwork and that you find something that speaks to you, as Avalon inspires me.

Rebecca</p>
