  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I’m a multi-media artist based on the ancient Isle of Avalon.</p>

<p>The stunning landscapes which surround me, from moor to coast, are my constant inspiration.</p>

<p>I love to create, and doing what I enjoy is a privilege which brings me joy.</p>

<p>If you’d like to purchase any of my artwork, from postcards to cards and giclee prints, or if you’d like to request a commission, then send me an email at rebecca@rebeccaofavalon.art </p>

<p>I hope you enjoy your visit to my virtual gallery, exploring my artwork and that you find something that speaks to you, as Avalon inspires me.</p>

<p>Rebecca</p>
